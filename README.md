# Data Structures and Algorithms from Scratch

In this repository I am implementing the **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** I have learnt from scratch with **`C/C++`**.

# Implemented

## Data Structures
- `Dynamic Array` in `C++` as `template class`
- `Singly Linked` List without `tail` in `C`
- `Singly Linked` List with `tail` in `C++` as `template class` 
- `Stack` with __my__ `Singly Linked List`in `C++` as  `template class` 
- `Queue` with __my__ `Singly Linked List`in `C++` as `template class` 

## Algorithms
- Marge Sort (for Linked List)
